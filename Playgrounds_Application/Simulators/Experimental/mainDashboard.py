        **Playgrounds Î© Explorer** is designed to give you deeper insight into historical protocol data.
        Using this tool, you can view the historical data for a single or multiple protocol metrics (i.e. RFV growth over time, supply growth,
        or even the current runway).
        
        Have some fun! We can't wait to see the insight you discover!

        **Instructions**
        - **Metrics filter tool**: Use the metrics filter dropdown tool to select the metric/metrics you care about! The chart is designed to scale and accommodate all protocol metrics available! 
        - **Date filter**: In addition to filtering by metrics, you can also filter by time frames. Use the Start/End Date filter to expand or narrow down your time scale
        - **Metrics Visualized**: The chart is an incredibly powerful tool for you to view and analyze your selected metric/metrics. Here are some cool things you can do:

            - Hide and view trend lines by clicking on the legend
            - Use the toolbar to access tools such as zoom, pan, data comparison, spike lines, and download
        
        - **Selected Metrics**: For the data table lovers, access your selected metrics in tabular form and download them as CSV!

    - Total Value Deposited: Total Value Locked, is the dollar amount of all OHM staked in the protocol. 
                            This metric is often used as growth or health indicator in DeFi projects.
                            
    - Treasury Market Value: Market Value of Treasury Assets, is the sum of the value (in dollars) of all assets held by the treasury.
    
    - Treasury Risk Free Value: Risk Free Value, is the amount of funds the treasury guarantees to use for backing OHM.
    
    - Reward Rate: Reward rate is the configured percentage of OHM distributed to all stakers on each rebase relative to the total supply. 
                    The reward rate is precisely set by the policy team, and voted upon by the community.
    
    - APY: Annual Percentage Yield, is the normalized representation of an interest rate,
            based on a compounding period over one year. 
            Note that APYs provided are rather ballpark level indicators and not so much precise future results.
            
    - Runway Available: Runway, is the number of days sOHM emissions can be sustained at a given rate. Lower APY = longer runway
